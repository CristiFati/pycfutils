---------- FILE MAINTAINED MANUALLY ----------

Records listed in reverse chronological order (most recent on top).
Users are encouraged to "log" their significant (relative term) changes like:
  - New features
  - Critical fixes

File is organized in sections where each section represents a release name
A release name is enclosed in square brackets and starts with a "v",
  just like its tag name (except for the first one which is "TBR")
Changes under each release are indented by 4 spaces and start with a hyphen ("-"):
    1.1. A PR (or issue) description
    1.2. The URL on the following line (aligned with the description)
or (if there's no PR / issue):
    2.1. A brief description
    2.2. Optionally (same alignment as #1.2.), separated by coma(s) (",") in any order:
        - Name (real, nick user) - starting with at ("@")
        - Date - YYYY/MM/DD, YY/MM/DD, YYYYMMDD, YYMMDD
        - Commit hash(es) - starting with a pound ("#")
